Bugs:
1. With Valgrind, I was able to check that there was a memory leak.
~Queue() is likely to empty.
2. In the documentation, dequeue @return , but dequeue should not return anything
since it is void.
3. Queue is FIFO. Enqueue() should add to the back.
The test showed that it is adding to front which is wrong.Leading peekFront() to be buggy.
